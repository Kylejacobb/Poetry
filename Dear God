Dear. god

Sometimes we go for weeks-
Maybe months that we don't speak.
A day to you might seem like
a lifetime to me-

Who is putting who on the back burner?
Luke warm -are these religions that claim to have your words.
Letting Go spells out -
the voice is unheard.

From people that pray over others like predators, they praise.
To the stories of war ships 
that were used to bring hate,
Angels being abandoned to a dumb king, left at the gate.
While the kingdom is being claimed.
claiming a need to be saved, but I think they misinterpret- when they ate from your guard then .
Confusion is what came as the burden. 
Is it just a game?

Dear God, 
It's hard not to blame you.
I can't believe the truth.
I can see only hell burning our homelands- 
And the fire rises above all roofs.
Consumed in self-righteousness and hatred.
How can we trust in man- when god gives up on his painting? 
Was our relationship not sacred?
Am I not worthy to be proof?

I spent years of my time
trying to find you.
Lately, I don't see you as often.

Mainly-because I am in denial of 
My hypocrisy and the indifferences that hath made me see through.
I only see through a mirrored finish.
In the eyes of what be new.
In the garden of what we grew.

A littered sea of literacy 
A dried up stream that no longer sees the waters because the greed consumed its lifeline.

And the blood of this planet now runs through
Pipelines.

As if it's the only way we can live is by taking Gaia’s life.
For what it's worth, I'm made of challenges that can’t be won.
These two eyes can’t see one.
These two ears can’t hear the sum.
As this ego is blinding 
-your son.
