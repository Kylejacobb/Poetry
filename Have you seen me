Have you seen me?

I am missing.
I havenâ€™t seen myself since the last time I was forgotten.
I suppose for good reason.
Lots of stories going around, mostly rotten.
I canâ€™t find myself. 

I used to have a family.
I used to have children.
I used to have friends.
I used to have sanity.

I used to have passions.
I used to have drive.
I used to have something to live for.

I used to recognize love.
I used to recognize kindness.
I used to recognize my heart beating.
nowadays, I canâ€™t even recognize my own eyelids.
All recognition is gone.
Left when I went missing.

Disowned by my family when they started theirs - anew.
I disowned myself because I wasnâ€™t worth the care.
Disowned myself when you came unglued. 

I spent years homeless, 
searching for my self.
myself was a hell of a lie.
The new new found self, 
again.
a shell of a life.

A shell that no longer speaks.
A shell that no longer breathes.

That shell of a child grew into a new shell of memories.
into a shelf of poetry.

A shell of a man that wasnâ€™t allowed to heal.
A shell of a man that was told his love isnâ€™t real.
A shell of a man that could never be.
A shell of a man- Have you seen me?

I am a missing person- Iâ€™m not lost.
I am only one missing.

I am only alone.
I seem to have forgotten.
It wasnâ€™t worth remembering.
I am missing.

I havenâ€™t seen myself since the last time I was forgotten.
I suppose for good reason.
Lots of stories going around, mostly rotten.
I canâ€™t find myself. 

I used to have a family.
I used to have children, friends, and sanity.

I used to have passions.
I used to have something to live for.
I used to have drive and peace of mind.
now all I got is war.
