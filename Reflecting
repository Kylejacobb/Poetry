Reflecting on those eyes,
A starry sky of last night-
a moment in time that never needed rhyme
or to be anything relating to the
 “what where who or why”-
all that’s known is a reflection of perspectives-
Reflected was a heart with solid directives, 
Guiding my directions with pure intentions-
or puppeteering these hands 
writing stories from our lives,
the songs of our days. 
The numbers of our time,
The symbols and signs,
The riddles of meanings,
Curses written in cursive,
Signing away life between the fading lines,
History buried alive, while the meaning to live seems one sided.
Wisdom is more than the reasons for life.
And Gnosis is more than logic and science. 
Devine guidance is in between those eyelids,
Below that halo of flowers and thorns being found in silence, hanging between the tips of those horns,
Crooked is the righteous.
