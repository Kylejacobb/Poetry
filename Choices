We all have choices. 
Alternatives are there.
Maybe it’s hard to see it.

it’s probably the stuff that we’re breathing,
probably isn’t even air.

lack of empathy and compassion.
does anyone know how to care?

narcissists and all this ego
blank stares. is anybody out there?

Love and Hate. 
It isn’t black and white.
It’s a whole spectrum of emotions,
It’s the individuals perspective. 
from their own sight.’

Daylight emotions swell.
I give them a break at night.
eyes starting to get heavy with the sunset,
and reality no longer seems in sight.
