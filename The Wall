The wall

I would rather buy back our dignity, then buy into enslavement.

This isn’t about freedom. It isn’t about rights.
If we had any of that- we might be able to unite.

The wall at the border is symbolic. 
It states “Entrapped and Divided We Stand”. 
Try to mess with that, and we’ll have your kids taken and raped in entrapment camps.

I can’t figure out what is real anymore,
I know that man’s greed is responsible for war.
I know that you aren’t innocent, for being blind to what you support.

We the people became weakened, 
genetics embedded with history of hate.
We the people lost love,
when the stage was set and we gave into their game.

This earth became sick,
When people chose power over the importance of resources and community.

They removed our dependence from the planet, moved it over to them. 
Why did we become dependent to the same system that make this world sick when this earth can provide everything that we need?

We are given this idea of being powerless, 
So let’s just throw our hands up like it isn’t our faults, like the problems don’t exist.

You play a role in every towel that you toss. 
You paved the way for the borders they crossed.
You seem to be able to conquer the rest of the odds.
You work toward bettering self, 
but can’t- because self is the cause.
You speak the truth, but to listen is hard.
You like it easy, so you blame the gods.
You want world peace, but we’re still buying cars.
You keep feeding the machine, but claim to stand against genocide and war.

Are we really this hopeless? 
Do you think owning a home takes you away from being homeless? 
Or were you never taught that home is where the heart is? 

Unfortunately, they took everyone’s heart and put them into little boxes. 
Gave them ideals that had them laying sod, mowing lawns, and building fences. 

A place where you can hide out, because the neighbors are weird and the world is too scary.
A place where there is no question to why,

Do you believe that ignorance is going to get you to heaven?

We’re in this place for a reason, 
And the possibilities can seem endless.
It’s time to break the walls down
To where that dead end is. 

So fuck it, were paying for Netflix and have the internets...
Speaking of which, that thing the cloud, it is taking tremendous amounts of energy to run.
and it’s so easy to not think about it. 
Because... you know- it’s in the cloud, right?

We all have choices. 
Alternatives are there.
Maybe it’s hard to see it?
Maybe it’s the stuff that we’re breathing,
Maybe it isn’t even air.

Love and Hate. 
It isn’t Black and white.
It’s a whole spectrum of emotions,
It’s the perspective from your sight.’

Daylight emotions swelling.
At night- I give them a break.
eyes starting to get heavy,
and reality starts to seem fake.

Right sides swinging heavy, 
while the left tends to bite. 
While both sides are fighting, 
you might be coerced to take sides.
By making that choice, you passively 
By making that claim, you vote to divide.

The left right brain is divided, 
maybe that’s a sign.

Don’t be fooled as history has a chance.
