If we all had nothing, 
how many do you got?

You might think to yourself,
I have this and this and this,
but this is all -
what they have not.

If they all have nothing,
and we have all,
is it not ill minded,
to take so much control?

say we find peace in a book,
but “theirs” gives them food 
that sew not a seed.
They say that God is in a book,
that God consumes them with greed.

blame for reasons
can’t come together.
blame actions on a book, 
never a savior.

Their is a crook, 
written in English,
Characters in a language confuse,
used to a judge, 
judge is a fraud 
and the language isn’t true.
