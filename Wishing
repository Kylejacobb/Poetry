Wishing.

I’m done wishing.
Wishing that I could go back in time-
Wishing that your love was mine.
Wishing that I had a chance to take back 
things that I can’t- 
Wishing on a wishing well that can’t seem to cough up what I want it to sell.
Maybe the wishes just aren’t real enough.

I guess you got what you wanted. 
I’m so broken and mind fucked that I no longer have a position in my own life.
So out of control- I am spiraling down into nothing.

I can’t even think of being with someone else- because the only person I love is you.

And I miss you more than you will ever know.
Every day. Every night. 
Fuck you for leaving me like this.
Fuck you for demeaning me like this.

You are the reason that I don’t have love in my life.
And you are the reason that I am stuck in the mess that I am in.
The words you left me with, fucked up my mind… and I’m sure it was your intention.

Congratulations- you fucked up my life.
I love you. I hate what you have done to me.
Yet all I want is to be with you.
I wish I was fucking dead because I don’t think you will ever love me.
