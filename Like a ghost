Like a ghost
My words idle,
Left without response.
Marked delivered and read.
I’m doubting if the messages
Are making it across.

I’m lost. 
In a fog. 
On the other side of some train tracks.
Noises coming from the dark. 

I’m lost.
like a ghost trying to talk-
all that is heard is mindless.

Silence makes up the responses in my head,
Wondering if I’m alive or not.
Because more times than not, 
I’m feeling dead.

Walking a grave yard 
Thinking it can’t be this hard.
Can life like this consist of a 
loving God?
Why is life this cruel God?

I killed myself.
A few times.
I’ve been on the other side 
And I know that when you don’t choose life-
It chooses it for you. 
This life.

Those bridges you never wanted to cross-
Will be placed under your feet to walk.

Those enemies you had in the past will become your guardian angels and you begin to see that every fear once had-
is now your reality. 

The prison walls of ones mind can be daunting. 

Discovering I didn’t know who I was.
Identity loss.
Never knowing how to trust. 
Sabotage.
Sabotaging my personal relationships.

Living so fluid -
that a constant cant be found. 
Balance is a thing of relativity-
when gravity anomalies exist within the ground.

That light at the end of the tunnel
might begin to fade- 
but if you make it to the other side - 
there is life. 

That fight in between the tunnels might leave you jaded,
But if you make it another day,
That is life.

That life making up the day to day,
Might not be what you see,
Might not be reality,
Might not be,
Might.
All Mighty.
Light of life.
I am me.
